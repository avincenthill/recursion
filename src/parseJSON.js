// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:
// var parseJSON = JSON.parse;

var parseJSON = function (json) {

Advanced Content
Our advanced content is intended to throw you in over your head, requiring you to solve problems with very little support or oversight, much like you would as a mid or senior level engineer. The following problem is no exception, and you may have to do a fair amount of work to get enough context to get started on the problem itself.

Replace parseJSON with your own function in src/parseJSON.js, and make the specs pass.
Use a recursive descent parser.
